# sAtools
The following nodejs application ( under development ) has been created just to provide minimal information about the status of most common automation tools such as Chef, Ansible and Puppet.

The information has been uploaded manually to the RedisDB, so i belive in the next version i will add the possibility to load the status of the tool directly from automation tools to the DB.


* Requirements: nodejs, npm & RedisDB

Ansible / Capture.
